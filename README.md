Clicking 'commit' will make this branch different from the master so now you can open a pull request.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

1. Click the  Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.
2.Select the branch you made, to compare with master (the original).
3.Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page.
4.When satisfied, click the big green Create Pull Request button.
5.Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.

Merge Pull Requests:
to bring changes together – merging the branch into the master branch.

Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
Click Confirm merge.
Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.
